 UKR_industrialisation_category_desc: "Ukraine has a huge potential for industrial development, but at the moment we have huge problems with logistics, because of the lag in mechanization our industrialization is moving extremely sluggishly.

We are waiting for the development of our natural resources, the electrification of cities and villages, the construction of city-forming industries and the creation of new cities and villages.\n\n§CПоказатель индустриализации§!: [?UKR_industrialization_score]\n\nНаш текущий прогресс в индустриализации составляет [UKR_industrialization_loc]"
