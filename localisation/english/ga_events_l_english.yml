 Wnews.1.t:0"Coronation of the Habsburgs in Ukraine"
 Wnews.1.d:0 "After several years of political instability and economic difficulties, the monarchist forces were able to establish control over the Ukrainian SSR. Representatives of the royal Habsburg dynasty have already expressed their desire to return to the throne in Ukraine, where they have significant support among the population. According to information from regional newspapers, actions are being held in the capital calling for the revival of the monarchy and the return of the Habsburgs to the Ukrainian throne. However, not all residents of the country support this idea, and the public is divided into two camps. The monarchical government believes that the return of the Habsburgs to the throne will help stabilize the political situation in the country and ensure economic growth. Some analysts believe that the restoration of the monarchy may also increase Ukraine's influence on the international stage. However, opposition forces and representatives of other nationalities living on the territory of Ukraine consider the idea of returning the monarchy to be outdated and incompatible with the principles of democracy and civil society. However, the possibility of a Habsburg coronation remains open and could have serious implications for the future of Ukraine and its relations with other states."

 Wnews.2.t:0"Coronation of the Skoropadskys in Ukraine"
 Wnews.2.d:0 "In Ukraine, they continue to discuss the possible coronation of the Skoropadskys, if the monarchical government is restored in the country. This became possible after recently the Ukrainian monarchists actively advocate the restoration of the monarchy in Ukraine, and also call for the return of the Skoropadsky house to the throne. Recall that in 1918, General Pavel Skoropadsky was proclaimed the head of the Ukrainian state, but his regime did not last and the general was forced to leave Ukraine. However, his descendants continue to live and work in Ukraine and abroad. If the monarchical government is restored in Ukraine, then the coronation of the heir to the Skoropadsky house is possible. But this is still far away, since Ukraine currently has a republican form of government. However, monarchists continue to hold actions and rallies to draw attention to their ideas."

 Wnews.3.d:0 "According to some sources, Ukraine is considering withdrawing from the Comintern, the international organization of communist parties. According to sources who do not want to be named, leaving the Comintern is becoming increasingly likely in the light of recent events in the country. Ukraine joined the Comintern in 1919, and since then it has been one of the important members of the organization. However, in recent years the Ukrainian authorities have become increasingly dissatisfied with the existing political and economic relations within the Comintern. It is assumed that the possible withdrawal of Ukraine from the Comintern may cause disapproval of other member countries of the organization and affect the international political situation as a whole. Some experts also note that withdrawal from the Comintern may lead to the strengthening of the position of conservative and anti-communist forces in Ukraine, which may lead to changes in the country's domestic policy."

According to sources, the choice of the monarch between two candidates is currently being considered - General P.P. Skoropadsky and representatives of the House of Habsburg. Both sides are trying to attract support from the population and convince them of the correctness of their ideas. One of the adherents of monarchical rule said that the monarchy would help strengthen the state, develop the economy, and increase Ukraine's prestige in the international arena. At the same time, opponents of the monarchy point to the risks associated with the establishment of monarchical rule, such as the restriction of freedom and rights of citizens. In any case, the decision on the choice of the monarch will be made in the near future, and this may affect the political and social situation in Ukraine in the future."

Political scientists believe that such a proposal could be directed, in particular, to Germany and Italy, which also profess monarchist ideals and have expressed support for Ukraine in the past. However, there are those who express doubts about the success of such a proposal, pointing to the unstable political situation in Europe and the possible negative reaction from the world community to such a step. It is not yet known whether such a proposal will be officially put forward and how other states will respond to it.

However, the opposition expressed concern about the loss of Ukraine's independence and sovereignty in the event of signing an alliance agreement with Romania.

An important event was the adoption in 1936 of the new constitution of the USSR, which established the federal structure of the state and secured the equality of the republics. Ukraine, as one of the republics of the USSR, received the rights to self-government, which made its position within the USSR more stable. However, between 1936 and 1939, Ukraine also faced some problems. During this period, a policy of "Ukrainization" was carried out, aimed at supporting the Ukrainian culture and language, but which also led to the strengthening of national sentiments. In addition, in the period from 1937 to 1938, large-scale political repressions took place in Ukraine, which affected many people.

An important step was the opening of the Krivoy Rog Mining and Metallurgical Plant, which became one of the largest in the USSR. New factories for the production of machine-building products were also opened, which were used both in Ukraine and in other regions of the Soviet Union. Much has been done to develop the oil refining industry. In 1936, the first oil refinery in the Donbass was launched, which produced not only gasoline, but also fuel oil, kerosene and other oil products.

However, the reaction of the Soviet authorities to these proposals was ambivalent: although the Politburo decree of April 28, 1935 allowed the arrival of 1,000 families from abroad, it was subject to extremely harsh conditions. Subsequently, it turned out that only 150-200 families were ready to receive in Birobidzhan, and only from Poland, Lithuania and Romania. However, after the creation of the Jewish Republic, Jews from all over the USSR and the world began to move to our republic, which will help raise the Jewish population in the region."

To organize a printing base, the first editor of the newspaper, Yankel Levin, was allowed to seek help from the Jewish diaspora in the city of Harbin, where newspapers in Yiddish were published at that time. Printing equipment and fonts received from China became part of the basis for the creation of the newspaper. At first, the newspaper was published three times a week, with a circulation of 2,000 copies. The first editor of the newspaper was Genekh Kazakevich. His son, Emmanuil, a well-known Soviet writer and winner of two Stalin Prizes of the second degree, also worked for the newspaper as a literary collaborator in the mid-1930s. By the Decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of May 7, 1934, the Jewish National District received the status of the Jewish Autonomous Region. "Birobidzhaner Stern" received the status of a regional newspaper. The circulation was increased to 4000 copies, the newspaper began to appear five times a week."

 SOV_GA.1.d:0 "“If the German people continue to humbly allow themselves to be led to destruction, without even trying to resist, then every day they will not only be weaker. Every day his guilt will get heavier. Then Hitler will have to be overthrown only by the forces of the Allied coalition. And this means the end of national independence ... If, on the contrary, the German people manage to rise up in time and prove with their own strength that the Germans also want the liberation of other peoples and are determined to free themselves from the power of Hitler, they will have the right to decide their own future fate and be heard in the world. This is the only way to preserve the very existence, freedom and honor of the German people.” \nThe essence of this document was reduced to a proposal to recognize the NKFG as the German government abroad and to form the German liberation troops "as the vanguard for the internal liberation struggle in Germany." The German Liberation Army "will contribute to a considerable extent to the final collapse of the Hitlerite system" and must, after the military defeat of Hitlerism, "smash it politically and guarantee the consolidation of successes. It can render unnecessary the mixed occupation of the allies with all its consequences - the demarcation line and zones of influence. At the same time, one should once again emphasize the propagandistic significance of this act."
